# Housing-Price-Prediction-Data-Analysis

Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project for predicting median house prices in California districts. The dataset used in this project was generated from a deep learning model trained on the California Housing Dataset. While the relationships between variables are expected to be similar to the original dataset, it's important to note that they may not be identical.

Project Objective

Our main goal in this project is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the median house value based on the given independent variables. To achieve this, we will perform a thorough data analysis, including data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and model development.

MedInc: Median income in block group.

HouseAge: Median house age in block group.

AveRooms: Average number of rooms per household.

AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms per household.

Population: Block group population.

AveOccup: Average number of household members.

Latitude: Block group latitude.

Longitude: Block group longitude.

Conclusion

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive guide to predicting median house prices in California districts. By analyzing the provided dataset and building predictive models, you can gain valuable insights into the factors that influence house prices and develop models for making accurate predictions.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and use the code and insights provided here for your own data analysis projects or further research in the field of housing price prediction.
